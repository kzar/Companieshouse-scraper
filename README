# companieshouse-scraper

A small Clojure scraper for the Companies house website. 
It grabs the information and saves it to a MySQL database.

## Usage
; Grab the project and launch clojure
git clone git@github.com:kzar/Companieshouse-scraper.git
cd Companieshouse-scraper/
lein deps
lein repl

; Get access to the scrapers stuff
(use 'companieshouse-scraper.main)

; Scrape 5 results and print the names
(companieshouse-scraper.main/search "Bob" 5
	       #(println (:name %)))

; Setup the DB
(companieshouse-scraper.main/setup-db "localhost" 3306 "companies" "root" "password")

; Scrape 10 results starting with names like Bob. 
; Save each to the database and pause for up to a second each time
(companieshouse-scraper.main/search "Bob" 10
	       #(do (save-company %) 
	            (. Thread sleep (rand 1000))
		    (println (:name %))))

## Installation

 - Get MySQL running with the proper schema:

create database companies;
use companies;
create table companies (id int not null auto_increment primary key, number varchar(255), name varchar(255), postcode varchar(10), address text, details text);

## Notes
 - Edge cases useful for testing:
; Search for "CHEERSTAGE PROPERTIES LTD." 6/7 results in - repeat
; Search for "A & J LTD" 3? results in - loop
; "A & J FRENCH (OXFORD) LIMITED" - No address or details!
; "A & L CF JUNE (1) LIMITED" - unusual formatting
; "a" - gives you 40 results instead of 80
; "AASB LIMITED", next result (A * ASBESTOS LTD) jumps companies house back to start!

## Todo
 - Instead of saving all the details as HTML figure out how to parse it
   (This is tricky because the website is basically a CMS and the content
   varies greatly.)

 - Add tests
 - Add docstrings
 - Make log-error function do something useful
