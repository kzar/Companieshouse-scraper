It grabs the information and saves it to a MySQL database.

## Usage
; Get access to the scrapers stuff
(use 'companieshouse-scraper.main)

; Setup the DB

; Scrape 5 results and print the names
(companieshouse-scraper.main/scrape-search "Bob" 10
	       #(println (:name %)))

; Scrape 10 results starting with names like Bob. 
; Save each to the database and pause for up to a second each time
(companieshouse-scraper.main/scrape-search "Bob" 10
	       #(do (save-company %) (. Thread sleep (rand 1000))))
